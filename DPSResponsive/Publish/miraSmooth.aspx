            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>What is the miraSmooth™ treatment?</strong><br />
                miraSmooth is a combination treatment, powered by miraWaveTM technology, that simultaneously and permanently reduces underam hair and sweat.  
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>What results can I expect?</strong><br />
                You can expect immediate and lasting results. Recent clinical information confirms significant reduction in underarm hair and an average of 82% sweat reduction in most patients. As with any aesthetic treatment results will vary by person.  
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Don’t I need sweat glands?</strong><br />
                Not in your armpits! You are born with approximately 2 million sweat glands throughout your body. Your underarms only contain about 2% of those glands. With miraDry you will experience the many benefits of stopping sweat in the underarm area, but you will continue to sweat elsewhere.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>What is the treatment like?</strong><br />
                You will be in a reclined position for about one hour. You aren’t likely to feel anything during the treatment since your underarms will be numbed prior to treatment. After treatment, you may experience swelling, soreness, tingling and numbness in the treated area. These sensations typically clear-up within a few days to a few weeks.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>How does it work?</strong><br />
                For permanent results in your underarm, the miraWave technology will heat and destroy hair follicles along with sweat and odor glands. Unlike lasers, miraWave doesn’t rely on hair color to work - which is what makes this procedure so revolutionary.  Hair follicles that are located in the area where we deliever energy will be destroyed regardless of color or hair growth stage.  Sweat and odor glands are also located in the area we’re delivering energy so those will also be destroyed.
            </li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><strong>How many treatments will I need?</strong><br />
                Your practitioner will likely use a combination treatment consisting of a single miraDry treatment followed with a short course of laser hair removal until you achieve satisfactory hair reduction, however the sweat reduction results will be immediate. As with any aesthetic treatment, your physician will determine the best protocol for your expected results.
            </li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Is the treatment painless?</strong><br />
                Since local anesthesia is administered to the underarm prior to the miraDry portion of the treatment, most patients experience little to no pain. 
            </li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Is there any downtime?</strong><br />
                Depending on what your typical day is like, downtime can be minimal to none. Most patients return to regular activity (like returning to work) immediately. Exercise and vigorous activity is typically resumed within several days. You may experience discomfort in your armpits for several days post treatment following the miraDry portion of the treatment.
            </li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Are there any side effects?</strong><br />
                For the miraDry portion of the treatment, some localized soreness or swelling will occur, and typically clears within a few weeks. Some patients have short-term altered sensation in the skin of their underarms or upper arms, which gradually disappears.

            </li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><strong>How much does it cost?</strong><br />
                Pricing can vary depending on your specific treatment protocol and will be discussed during your consultation.
